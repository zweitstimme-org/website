[{"content":"Two weeks ago, we published forecasts for the state elections in Saxony and Thuringia. Today, two days before the election, we are updating these forecasts using our prediction model, based on the polls published in the meantime for Saxony and Thuringia. Based on previous state elections from 2010 to 2023, we know that our forecasts two days before the election are already very accurate. We have an average absolute deviation of 1.46 percentage points across all parties, which is very close to the final result.\nThe Forecast Saxony In Saxony, the neck-and-neck race between the CDU and the AfD continues. We expect the CDU to receive 29.7% of the votes, with our forecast two days before the election allowing a 5/6 probability that this value will lie within the credibility interval between 24.3% and 35.5%. The AfD is expected to make significant gains and, in our projections, narrowly surpasses the CDU with 31.5%. However, this interval also ranges from 25.9% to 37.6%. This results in a 62.8% probability that the AfD will become the strongest force.\nThe newly founded Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) is certain to enter the state parliament; we expect 17.4% (5/6 credibility interval between 13.6% and 21.6%). For the SPD, we expect a vote share of 6.3% (interval: 4.8% to 8.0%). For the Greens, it will be close whether they enter the state parliament, with an expected share of 5.3% (interval: 4.1% to 6.8%). The probability of this happening is 60%. The chances for the Left are slim, at 3.9% (interval: 3.0% to 4.9%). The FDP is also expected to miss the threshold to enter the state parliament with 1.6% (interval: 1.2% to 2.1%). The remaining vote shares go to \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; parties, which are not shown in the figures.\nWhat does this mean for potential government formation? The likelihood of a parliamentary majority for the incumbent CDU-SPD-Greens government is relatively low at 7%, partly due to the uncertain probability of the Greens entering the parliament. A majority for the CDU without the AfD is most likely with the BSW (78%), especially with the inclusion of the SPD (88%).\nThuringia In Thuringia, the AfD is expected to become the strongest force with an 88% probability. We anticipate they will receive 29.5% of the votes. However, two days before the election, there is still room for variability in our forecast; the 5/6 credibility interval ranges between 23.9% and 35.4%. We expect the Left to lose significant support, with 14.3% (interval: 11.3% to 17.7%). The CDU could reach around 20.7%, with the interval ranging from 16.5% to 25.2%.\nThe Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) could achieve a surprising success with 22.9%, entering the state parliament as a strong party (interval: 18.0% to 27.7%). The Greens are likely to remain in the lower range with 3.3% (interval: 2.5% to 4.2%), and the SPD with 6.0% (interval: 4.6% to 7.5%). The FDP also has little chance of overcoming the five-percent threshold in Thuringia, with 2.4% (interval: 1.8% to 3.0%).\nWith this outcome, it will be challenging to form a majority government that excludes the AfD. It is already clear that the previous minority government of the Left, SPD, and Greens no longer represents a majority; the probability for this is 0%. Instead, other coalitions are possible, though not necessarily politically desired. A coalition between the CDU, BSW, and SPD has a 67% probability of achieving a parliamentary majority, while a coalition of BSW, the Left, and SPD has a 13% chance of securing a majority. Therefore, the political situation will remain interesting even after the election.\nThe Forecast Model At the Congress of the German Association for Political Science 2024, from September 24th to 27th in Göttingen, we will present a research paper on our forecast model for state elections. Our predictions are based on a Bayesian regression model that we estimate using data from all state elections since 1990, and then use to forecast the upcoming state elections. For forecasting, we use information on the parties' participation in government, whether a party holds the position of Prime Minister, whether a party is new to the state elections, the party\u0026rsquo;s last election result, the average deviation of the party in national polls from the last federal election result, and the average support in the polls published by various polling institutes before the state election. The state-specific polls have the greatest influence on our forecasts.\n","permalink":"https://zweitstimme.org/en/posts/state_election_forecast_2days/","summary":"Two weeks ago, we published forecasts for the state elections in Saxony and Thuringia.

We at Zweitstimme have now developed a forecasting model for state elections and are pleased to present our forecasts on this page, two weeks ahead of the elections.\nThe Forecast Saxony In Saxony, our current forecast shows a close race between the CDU and the AfD. For the CDU, which was the largest party in the last election, we expect 30.0% of the votes. However, our forecast two weeks before the election still allows for a 5/6 probability that this value will fall within the credibility interval of 23.5% to 37.0%. The AfD, on the other hand, is expected to significantly improve, and in our estimation, it might narrowly surpass the CDU with 30.6%. However, this interval also ranges from 24.0% to 37.6%.\nThe newly founded Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) could achieve a strong result with 17.5%, with a 5/6 credibility interval between 12.7% and 22.7%. The SPD is expected to stabilize at a low level, with an expected vote share of 6.5% (interval: 4.7% to 8.6%), along with the Greens at 5.5% (interval: 3.9% to 7.3%) and Die Linke at 4.2% (interval: 3.0% to 5.5%). The FDP is expected to clearly miss the entry into the state parliament with 1.7% (interval: 1.2% to 2.4%). The remaining shares of the vote are attributable to “other” parties, which are not shown in the figures.\nWhat does this mean for the future political landscape in Saxony? Our forecast allows us to calculate probabilities for certain events. The probability that the CDU will become the strongest party is 47.8%. However, it will be difficult to form a majority government for the CDU without the AfD. The probability that there will be a majority for the incumbent CDU-SPD-Greens government is rather low at 13.3%. This is also due to the fact that the Greens are only expected to enter the state parliament with a probability of 62.6%. A government majority for the CDU without the AfD is most likely with the BSW (74.5%), especially with the addition of the SPD (84.4%).\nThuringia In Thuringia, the AfD now dominates the political landscape, and we expect it to emerge as the strongest force with 28.6% of the vote. However, two weeks before the election, there is still a lot of room for variation in our forecast, with the 5/6 credibility interval ranging from 22.0% to 35.7%. Die Linke, despite its prime minister Ramelow, is expected to lose significant support. Two weeks before the election, we expect only 15.3% (interval: 11.3% to 19.7%). The CDU, which also performed well in the last election, could now reach around 20.1%, with the interval ranging from 15.2% to 25.5%.\nThe Bündnis Sarah Wagenknecht (BSW) could achieve a surprising success with 22.6% and enter the state parliament directly as the second strongest party (interval: 16.6% to 28.9%). The Greens are likely to remain in the lower range with 3.4% (interval: 2.4% to 4.6%) and the SPD with 6.2% (interval: 4.5% to 8.2%). The FDP also has little chance of surpassing the five percent hurdle in Thuringia with 2.5% (interval: 1.7% to 3.3%).\nOur forecasting model also allows us to specify probabilities for concrete events in Thuringia. The AfD is likely to become the strongest party in the state parliament with a probability of 77.7%. Since most parties have ruled out participating in a government with the AfD, it will be difficult to organize majorities. It is already clear that the previous minority government of Die Linke, SPD, and Greens will no longer be a majority constellation; the probability for this is 0%. Instead, other alliances are possible but not necessarily politically desired. A coalition between the CDU, BSW, and SPD has a 59.9% probability of achieving a parliamentary majority, while an alliance of BSW, Die Linke, and SPD has a 23.4% probability.\nThe Forecast Model Our forecasts are based on a Bayesian regression model, which we estimate using data from all state elections since 1990 and then use to predict the upcoming state elections. For the forecast, we use information about the parties' participation in government, whether a party holds the office of Minister-President, whether a party is running for state elections for the first time, the party\u0026rsquo;s last election result, the party\u0026rsquo;s average deviation in nationwide polls from the last federal election result, and the average support in the polls published before the state election by various polling institutes. The polls in the state have the greatest influence on the forecast.\nHow well does our model work? We have evaluated the model based on state elections since 2010 and used it to predict these state elections as a test, using only data available before the respective state elections. On average, the absolute deviation from the final result two weeks before the election is 2.19 percentage points. This means that a lot can still happen in the next two weeks. If we make the forecast two days before the election, on Friday 30th of August, the forecast becomes more accurate, and we are much closer to the final result with an average absolute deviation of 1.46 percentage points.\n","permalink":"https://zweitstimme.org/en/posts/state_election_forecast/","summary":"In two weeks, German state elections will be held in Saxony and Thuringia.

These include, for example, the performance of parties in past elections, historical polling data, and information on whether a party provided the chancellor. In other words, the structural component learns from the regularities of all past federal elections. Thus, having this information early (as early as 200 days before the election) allows us to predict the outcome of the election early.\nHowever, the structural component alone is often not sufficient to reflect short-term readjustments in the party system or fluctuations in the political mood. We therefore use published values of the so-called Sunday poll to account for the dynamics of an election. To put it simply, for the actual forecast we mix information about the regularities of past elections with what we can observe in the polls at the moment. While the structural component of the model remains stable, we update our forecast with each new poll released.\nDepending on how far in the future the election date is, the two components of our model are weighted differently. For example, if the election is still very far in the future, the prediction based solely on polls is very uncertain because they are very volatile over time. Accordingly, more weight is initially given to the prediction of the structural model. As election day approaches, the model\u0026rsquo;s confidence in the survey component increases as it becomes more accurate. Our forecast thus mostly represents a compromise between what one would expect based on historical data and what one currently observes in the polls.\nOur model is estimated using a so-called MCMC algorithm. Figuratively speaking, the election outcome is simulated many times; for example, 100,000 times. These simulations can then be used to calculate probabilities for all events that are directly related to the predicted party shares. For example, if the CDU/CSU is ahead of the SPD in about 80,000 of the simulations, this corresponds to an estimated 80% probability that the CDU/CSU will do better than the SPD in the election.\nThe constituency model On the ground in the constituencies, the election campaign often focuses on the question: Who will be directly elected to the next Bundestag? The first vote also directly determines the composition of the Bundestag. The 299 constituency winners receive their mandate in the next Bundestag - regardless of how their party performs overall. So it is definitely of interest who wins in which constituency. It is at least as exciting to have an estimate of which constituencies could be particularly close before election night. Using our constituency model, we can calculate how likely each party\u0026rsquo;s candidate is to win the constituency.\nOur constituency forecast is based on several assumptions that take us from our simulated second vote results to the 299 potential constituency winners:in.\nFirst, we calculate the nationwide proportional \u0026ldquo;swing\u0026rdquo; (i.e., the change in outcome for a party between two elections) between the 2017 election result and each of our simulation results. For example, the CDU/CSU had won 30.2% of the second votes in 2017. If the CDU/CSU now has 25% in a simulation result of our model, that is 5.2 percentage points less than in 2017, or proportionally -17.2% (note the difference between percentages and percentage points).\nWe then transfer this proportional swing to the constituency results (converted to constituencies for 2021) of 2017, obtaining simulated distributions of second votes in each of the 299 constituencies. For example, if the CDU/CSU had 50% of the second votes in a constituency in 2017, it is now 41.4% with the assumption of proportional swing. If the CDU/CSU had only 35% of the second votes in another constituency in 2017, it is now still 28.9%. We calculate this swing for all parties, all constituencies and all simulation runs.\nTo get from the second votes in the constituency to first votes, we need another assumption: how do first and second votes in the constituency relate to each other? To do this, we first assume that the ratio of first to second votes in the constituency will be the same as in 2017. We replace this ratio in constituencies where previous constituency winners do not run again with an average candidate from the same party in the same state. We do the same for popular non-winners who do not run again. Thus, we now get simulation distributions for all candidates in each constituency. For each simulation we then get one person who wins the direct mandate in the constituency. To calculate probabilities, we add up the constituency winners of the parties across all simulations and divide the sum by the number of our simulations.\nThis is also the difference to other constituency forecasts. We can say something about how (in)certain our predictions of the constituency winners:in are. This works because, as described above, we calculate a probability for each of the people running in a constituency to win their constituency.\n","permalink":"https://zweitstimme.org/en/posts/publications/","summary":"For us as scientists, it is important that our forecasts are transparent and comprehensible.\nSince 2017, we have published several (peer-reviewed) scientific articles on our model.
